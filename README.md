# Columbia Data API

# Description

Provides an API for student programmers to access information on Columbia resources, such as housing, courses, dining, and student and faculty directories.

The documentation for the API is provided here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YW2meOaDT6LEmJ8xcCDemSlCwW4FyWJQwpJrg1vFNyk/edit?usp=sharing

# Motivation

The Data@CU project has been a longstanding ADI initiative to provide open access to Columbia data related resources for the student community. Unfortunately, the website is no longer maintained, relied on deprecated software infrastructure and, appropriately, had stopped functioning. Therefore, our ADI Labs Team worked on rebuilding the API from the ground up, creating a more robust and manageable web framework and database organization for both maintainability and ease of end-user use.

# To Use

Users first need to create an account using a uni email address. After account creation, a user can login and receive a hashed API key to include in GET requests to our server.
